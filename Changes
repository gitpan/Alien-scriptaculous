    - added POD coverage tests
    - now depends on Alien::Prototype, instead of using the version that came
      bundled with script.aculo.us.
    - fix dependency on Archive::Tar; its a -build- dependency, not a
      -configuration- dependency
    - added "passthrough" Makefile.PL; we -NEED- to have Module::Build

    - added POD docs to Alien::scriptaculous

    - removed un-necessary "use" statements and imports from MY::Build
